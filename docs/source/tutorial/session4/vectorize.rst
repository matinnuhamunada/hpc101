        **Objectives:**
            * Learn how to use vectorize to implement ufunc.

Numba's vectorize feature enables Python functions that take scalar inputs to be used as NumPy ufuncs.
 By applying the vectorize() decorator, Numba compiles a pure Python function into a ufunc that can 
 process NumPy arrays with performance comparable to traditional ufuncs written in C. As with any 
 Numba function, you can choose between eager or lazy mode for vectorization.

    from numba import vectorize, int32, int64, float32, float64

    @vectorize([int32(int32, int32),
                int64(int64, int64),
                float32(float32, float32),
                float64(float64, float64)])
    vec_test(x, y):
        return x + y

When specifying multiple signatures, make sure to list the most specific ones before the more general
ones.
