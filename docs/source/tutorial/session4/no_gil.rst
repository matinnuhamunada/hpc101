        **Objectives:**
            * Learn how to disable GIL in Numba.


Since Numba optimizes Python code, it's no longer necessary to hold Python's Global Interpreter Lock 
(GIL). By passing ``nogil=True```, Numba will release the GIL when entering the compiled function. 
Releasing the GIL can enable concurrent code execution in multi-threaded environments, but it is 
important to consider the implications of race conditions and synchronization issues.

.. admonition:: Key Points
   :class: hint

    #. GIL is not necessary in Numba generated code.
    #. Programmers should be careful with ``nogil`` mode in multi-threaded programming.
    #. ``nogil``` mode goes hand-in-hand with ``nopython`` mode
