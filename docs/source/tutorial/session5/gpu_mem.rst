    #. Learn how we can manually manage memory in Numba.
    #. Understand how to transfer data between host and device.

Although Numba can automatically transfer NumPy arrays to the device and back, we can prevent 
unnecessary transfers by manually controlling the transfer process.

Host to device copy:

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    data_cpu = np.arange(10)
    data_gpu = cuda.to_device(data_cpu)

Device to host copy:

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    data_cpu = data_gpu.copy_to_host()


or ...

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    data_gpu.copy_to_host(data_cpu)
